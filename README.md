# RanNum-Game-Porbability-Project
This is just a project I made to improve my Java and practice working out probabilities.

The way you play the game is you will get 10 random numbers from 1 to 1000. When you get a number you have to rank it from 1 to 10 depending on what order you think that number will be in the end. So you'd give rank 1 to what you think will be the smallest number and rank 10 to the biggest. If you get a number that you can't fit into the ranking you lose.

In the code, X numbers are the number from 1 to 1000, bArray is the slots available between ranks.
